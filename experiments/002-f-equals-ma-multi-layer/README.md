# $F = ma$ - multi-layer

Now taking `001` and looking at what happens with multiple layers (still maintaining two hidden neurons for ease of visualisation).

## Expectations/hopes

I'm hoping this will help understand what happens when these simple multiplication algorithms that I've found have capacity to grown into neighbouring layers. Maybe that will give some insight into what happens in bigger (more practical) networks.

My expectation is to perhaps see intermediate steps or perhaps multiple rounds of the previous modes to further hone the result. Let's see.
