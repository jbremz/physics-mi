# F=ma

This is a trivially simple idea just to set up the problem before I move onto more interesting ones.

## The plan

- Define a very small neural network (really doesn't need to be more than a single layer sans activation, but I'll probably try a few things)
- Train it to predict `F` from inputted values `m` and `a` all generated from toy data, maybe I'll add some noise

## Expectations/hopes

Some simple layer will emerge that acts to multiply `m` and `a` together
