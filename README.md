# Mechanistic Interpretability with physics data

I have this idea to look inside models that are trained to model physics data (raw measured physical quantities) to examine how they learn relationships and whether there are any emergent physical models that I can discern.

Maybe this is a stupid idea but I'm keen to play around (without having done _too_ much of a literature review) as that'll probably provide me with the most intuitive insight.
